## 🚨 MISSION BRIEFING
**Civilian Life is boring.** Chores are the enemy.
**Military Baby** is the weapon.

This isn't just a to-do list app. It is a **Tactical Operations Interface** designed to gamify adulthood for the next generation. By leveraging the multimodal power of **Google Gemini**, we transform mundane commands like *"Clean your room"* into high-stakes, sci-fi military missions—complete with a gritty "Kid Commander" voice barking orders at you.

**The Goal:** Stop doing chores. Start completing missions.

## ⚡ THE ARSENAL (Key Features)

* **🎙️ The "Kid Commander" AI:** We don't use standard text-to-speech. We use **Gemini's Multimodal capabilities** to generate a custom, high-energy voice briefing that treats you like a soldier in a sci-fi movie.
* **📜 Instant Mission Generation:** Type in *any* task, and watch it mutate into a "Classified Operation" with threat levels, tactical steps, and sci-fi jargon.
* **📟 "Neon-Nexus" Terminal UI:** A futuristic, glowing interface designed to captivate kids (and adults who refuse to grow up).
* **🚀 Zero Friction:** No login. No database. Just instant access to the battlefield.
